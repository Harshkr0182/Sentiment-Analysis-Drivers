# ðŸ§  Driver Sentiment Analysis System â€“ Multimodal Emotion Detection

A real-time, multimodal emotion detection system that analyzes a driver's emotional state using:

- ðŸ”¤ Text-based sentiment analysis  
- ðŸŽ¥ Facial emotion detection via webcam  
- ðŸŽ¤ Voice tone analysis via microphone  

This system aims to identify signs of fatigue, anger, or distraction â€” helping reduce road accidents by monitoring driver behavior through various sensory inputs.
