# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis of Drivers using Python ML

This mini project uses machine learning to detect driver emotions from text input. Helps in identifying fatigue, aggression, or distraction to improve road safety.

## 📌 Features
- Simulates driver feedback (text-based)
- Trains a Naive Bayes classifier
- Predicts emotion as positive or negative
- Easy to expand for real-world data

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- CountVectorizer
- Naive Bayes Classifier

## 📁 Files
- `driver_sentiment_model.py` – ML model training and prediction
